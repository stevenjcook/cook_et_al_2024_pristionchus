# Cook et al 2024 - Mind of a Predatory Worm

This repository is associated with the preprint <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.13.598904v1.abstract">Comparative connectomics of two distantly related nematode species reveals patterns of nervous system evolution. <a> Requirements and input files necessary to run this code are located within. Precise location of input files will need to be updated within the code. Accessory scripts have been tested on Windows and MacOS devices with no specialty hardware necessary. 

# Figures and Analysis

All main analysis and code necessary to generate figures in this publication are located in <a href="https://github.com/stevenjcook/cook_et_al_2024_pristionchus/tree/main/figures_analysis">figures_analysis</a>. This code has been used exclusively on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>. Total time necessary to run all cells is ~5 min.

# Accessory Scripts

Scripts necessary to generate neuronal adjacency and circuit diagram files are also included, with instructions for running python scripts included within headers. Time required to analyze neuronal adjacency will vary depending on number of available threads, and will range from minutes to days.
